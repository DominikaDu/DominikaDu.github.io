### Precision Quantum Metrology

<!-- Precision metrology is important in our everyday lives - we need an accurate measure of distance everytime we use the GPS in our phones, or precise force and acceleration sensors everytime we fly in an airplane. Precision quantum metrology is a branch of physics which applies quantum-mechanical principles to improve the precision of all kinds of measurements we make: time, distance, force, or phase to list a few. Even though metrology can seem like an applied science, my excitement for quantum metrology stems from the possibilities it allows to study the most fundamental laws of Nature. -->
Precision quantum metrology is a branch of physics which applies quantum-mechanical principles to improve the precision of all kinds of measurements we make: time, distance, force, or phase to list a few. This not only has many industrial applications, such as for navigation systems, biomedical imaging or computer chip manufacturing, but it also bears a very fundamental relevance - quantum-gravity experiments and dark matter detection are a few such areas where the toolkit of precision metrology has experienced a growing interest recently.

#### Current research:

#### Studying Quantum Gravity through Precision Quantum Metrology

As a graduate student at MIT, I've joined Professor Vivishek Sudhir to use precision quantum metrology to study the interface between quantum physics and gravity, one of the biggest remaining puzzles of modern Physics. We are currently designing an experiment to control a single electron in a Penning trap and use precision force measurements to detect its recoil due to the Hawking-Unruh radiation. This is very exciting as the Hawking-Unruh radiation, related to the more popular radiation mechanism by which black holes are thought to "evaporate", hasn't yet been experimentally confirmed.

#### Past projects:

#### Optomechanical Squeezing for Improved Gravitational Wave Detection

In summer 2018, I joined Professor Nergis Mavalvala and colleagues at the MIT LIGO Laboratory to perform an experiment aimed at producing optomechanically squeezed states of light to improve the precision of gravitational wave detectors. I was specifically in charge of designing and building the intensity stabilisation servo (ISS) to suppress the classical noise in a laser and thus prepare a quantum-noise limited beam for the rest of the experiment.

### Astrophysics

#### Current research: 

#### Super-Resolution Galaxy Imaging

This is a project I did for my Master's Thesis, and I've continued working on it. We have created a machine-learning model which can turn galaxy images from ground-based telescopes into space-telescope-like quality images. We are currently preparing this work for publication.

#### Past projects:

#### Reconstructing Quasar Continua to Study the Epoch of Reionization

Here is a [recorded talk](http://sazerac-conference.org/2020/talks.html) I gave at the [SAZERAC](http://sazerac-conference.org/2020/) conference in July 2020. You can find out more about this research project in our [paper](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/493/3/4256/5741730?redirectedFrom=fulltext) (also on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01050)).

#### Identifying Lyman Continuum Leakers in the Epoch of Reionization

Read more about this project in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01734).

#### Photometric Observations of the TrES-1 b Exoplanet

Back in the penultimate year of high school is Slovakia, I got involved with the observatory in my hometown Hlohovec, where I studied transiting exoplanets as my very first research experience. We performed multi-band photometric observations of the TrES-1b exoplanet in Lyra with the local 60cm Cassegrain telescope, reduced and analysed the data, and finally published the transit light curves in the [Exoplanet Transit Database](http://var2.astro.cz/ETD/).
