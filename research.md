### Precision Quantum Metrology

<!-- Precision metrology is important in our everyday lives - we need an accurate measure of distance everytime we use the GPS in our phones, or precise force and acceleration sensors everytime we fly in an airplane. Precision quantum metrology is a branch of physics which applies quantum-mechanical principles to improve the precision of all kinds of measurements we make: time, distance, force, or phase to list a few. Even though metrology can seem like an applied science, my excitement for quantum metrology stems from the possibilities it allows to study the most fundamental laws of Nature. -->

#### Current research:

#### Studying Quantum Gravity through Precision Quantum Metrology

As a graduate student at MIT, I've joined Professor Vivishek Sudhir to use precision quantum metrology to study the interface between quantum physics and gravity.

#### Past projects:

#### Optomechanical Squeezing for Improved Gravitational Wave Detection

In summer 2018, I joined Professor Nergis Mavalvala and colleagues at the MIT LIGO Laboratory to perform an experiment aimed at producing optomechanically squeezed states of light to improve the precision of gravitational wave detectors.

### Astrophysics

#### Current research: 

#### Cross-Telescopic Super-Resolution Galaxy Imaging

This is a project I did for my Master's Thesis, and I've continued working on it. Our aim is to create a machine-learning model which can turn galaxy images from ground-based telescopes into space-telescope-like quality images.
