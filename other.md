Here are some other projects I've been involved in.

### Unimak
<br/>
Unimak is a volunteer group of over 60 Slovak and Czech students from top universities around the world. Our mission is to spread awareness of the possibilities for young Slovaks and Czechs to study at world leading universities. Our activities include advising on issues related to choosing and applying to universities abroad, outreach talks, [videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSzDttGeQ_Dn4Q1XW6malmw/featured?view_as=subscriber) and [blogs](https://dennikn.sk/autor/oxbridge-admissions/).

I have been involved ever since entering my undergraduate studies in 2016. In 2019/2020, I served as the president.

### Encouraging Women Across All Borders
<br/>
In the summer of 2019, I co-founded Encouraging Women Across All Borders (EWAAB) with my good friend Kaitlin Gili. Our vision was to create a platform to:
- **encourage** undergraduate women to be more confident in their academic abilities as well as other passions,
- **provide** them with tools to boost their communication and leadership skills,
- **connect** them to a global support network of inspirational women, both junior and senior.

We managed to kick off the EWAAB mentoring program (later known as Encourage Her) at 8 universities ranging from Canada to Australia in the inaugural year. Since then, EWAAB has expanded beyond the mentoring program, and is now also building a separate platform for our network as well as a virtual library of short videos of inspirational speakers talking about the challenges they've faced.
